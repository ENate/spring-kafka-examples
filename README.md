# kafka spring Boot, spring kafka projects

In this example, we demonstrate a basic kafka producer and consumer example using spring boot and spring kafka. To run the example, we need the following technology stack:

+ kafka
+ spring-boot v.2.7.0
+ mysql
+ spring cloud JPA
+ Spring web
+ docker and docker-compose
+ jdk 17+

## Steps to run the codes

Clone the repository using:

```git

git clone https://github.com/ENate

```

Also, we need to install ``kafka`` using the instructions on the Kafka homepage. The directories consist of the repository consist of the following projects:

+ Kafka producer service named ``producer-service``
+ And a consumer service named ``consumer-service``

Each of the projects can be run separately as individual services. Note that ``jdk 17+`` are required to run the examples.
