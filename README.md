# kafka spring Boot, spring kafka projects

In this example, we demonstrate a basic kafka producer and consumer example using spring boot and spring kafka. To run the example, we need the following technology stack:

+ kafka
+ springboot
+ mysql
+ spring cloud JPA
+ Spring web

### Steps to run the example

Clone the repository using:

```git

git clone https://github.com/ENate

```

Also, we need to install ``kafka`` using the instructions on the Kafka homepage. The directories consist of the repository consist of the following projects:

+ Kafka producer example named ``producer-consumer``
+ And a consumer example named ``consumer-example``

Each of the projects can be run separately to demonstrate the power of spring kafka. Note that ``jdk 11+`` are required to run the examples.
